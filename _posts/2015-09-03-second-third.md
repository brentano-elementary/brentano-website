The instructional philosophy of the 2nd and 3rd grade teams are derived from
the principles of exploration and Project Based Learning (PBL). Our
inter-disciplinary approach incorporates reading and writing across math,
science, social studies, and technology integration. Students utilize
laptops and iPads as means to enhance and support their learning. Students
at these grade levels are making the exciting transition from learning to
read, to reading to learn. Topics researched throughout the year include
the History of Chicago, Women in History, Transportation, Great Scientific
Discoveries, and Space Exploration just to name a few.

Room 204 in particular practices an in depth study of Mexico, Diego Rivera, and
Frida Kahlo. The CFE (Chicago Foundation for Education) grant that was received
made it possible to provide the necessary materials needed in order to purchase
art materials. With supplies in hand the students are free to unleash their
artistic abilities. The replications of the great works done by of these two
outstanding artists are truly impressive.

To further their study, students research Mexican recipes which is bound in
individual student cookbooks. We are always enthusiastic about sampling some of
those enticing selections. To culminate our unit, students visit the Field
Museum. This venue is chosen because of the numerous realistic exhibits that
the museum has to offer on civilizations and Mexican antiquity. Please stop by
room 204 and take a tour of our studentâ€™s exceptional murals and read our
informative research papers. We will be delighted to engage with you on any and
all topics related to our unit.

The curricula includes:

* Erickson Math Innovations Project; provides intensive professional
development and coaching for our PreK through 3rd grade instructors
