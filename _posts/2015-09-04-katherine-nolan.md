#### Counseling Philosophy
I believe in educating the whole child. This means that I am concerned with the
child social/emotional status as this impacts his or her ability to process
information and learn in the classroom. I also believe that college and career
goals significantly impact the student’s motivation to learn. The child needs
these pieces, along with academics to be a successful learner in the school
setting and beyond.

My theoretical orientation, on the other hand, combines Brief Solution-Focused
Therapy and Choice Theory. This means that in my work with students, I focus on
what the child can do in the immediate future to alleviate the problem
presented. If the child’s issue requires more in-depth psychological work, I
will refer to a local agency.
