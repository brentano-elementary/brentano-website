        <p>In the early 1900’s Brentano became a Math and Science Academy. This new focus was a step to improve math and science instruction in CPS. The curriculum utilized was developed by the University of Chicago and is still strongly implemented in every classroom today. Our research-based math programs include Everyday Math (K-5), Math Thematics (6-8), and EDC (8th). Science curriculum includes a hands on exploratory approach developed through a program called FOSS (Full Option Science Systems) as well as Science and Technology for Children (STC); a program in which students expand on physical science, chemical electricity, earth changes, the human body, microorganisms, simple machines, astronomy and energy sources. </p>

        <p>Among many support structures for our students, Brentano also has a multitude of after school programs and activities. These include Chemistry Club, Chess Club, Drama Club, Computer Reading Club, Genius Science Club, Girls on the Run (fitness club), Rocket Club, Stellar Girls Science Program, Photography Club, Newspaper Club, and Joffrey Ballet. We also provide sports programs such as boys and girls soccer, track and field, volleyball, cheerleading, dance, basketball, and flag football.
