    <div class='col-sm-8'>

      <p>Brentano is an extraordinary neighborhood school in the heart of Logan Square.</p>

      <p>At Brentano, we believe children thrive when they have joy, high expectations, and instruction that makes them think, not just listen.</p>

      <p>We emphasize inquiry, problem-solving, and project based learning in order to make work challenging and relevant for all students. We prioritize the arts as well as science, math, and technology as help each student grow into a well-rounded citizen of Chicago and the world.</p>

      <p>At Brentano, the foundation for our work is love, commitment, and big dreams for all children.  We invite you to visit, tour, and learn more about our school.</p>
