        <p>At Brentano our philosophy is to empower students as leaders in learning. We believe students are most engaged, most productive, and best served by teaching that centers on discovery and problem-solving. Our students pursue math and literacy daily, plus an inquiry block comprised of project-based science and social studies units.</p>

        <p>We are committed to educating the whole child. Our students take PE, Music, Drama Visual Arts, and Spanish classes during the school day, plus a range of extracurricular activities.</p>

        <p>Brentano offers play-based prekindergarten in both full-day and half-day settings. Our prekindergarten students learn in either a general education setting, with a teacher and an aide for a class of 20 students, or a blended setting with a general education teacher, a special education teacher, and an aide for an inclusive class of 20 students.</p>
