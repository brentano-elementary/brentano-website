        <p>At Brentano our philosophy is to empower students as leaders in learning. We believe students are most engaged, most productive, and best served by teaching that centers on discovery and problem-solving. Our students pursue math and literacy daily, plus an inquiry block comprised of project-based science and social studies units.</p>

        <p>We are fully committed to educating the whole child. Each of our Kindergarten through 8th grade students has PE every day, plus an hour of arts enrichment daily including drama, music, and visual arts.</p>

        <p>Brentano has an excellent and motivated teaching staff, which engages in continuous learning through partnerships with UIC, the University of Chicago, the Erikson Institute, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Brookfield Zoo, Boundless Readers, and many other institutions.</p>
