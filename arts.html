        <p>At Brentano, arts are a core component of our curriculum. We are very proud of our full programs in drama, music, and visual arts. All our Kindergarten through 8th grade students have an hour of arts enrichment daily plus 30 minutes of PE every day.</p>

        <p>Throughout the year Brentano students publish and share their creative work through musicals and plays, arts festivals, and gallery exhibitions in our school and in our neighborhood.</p>
