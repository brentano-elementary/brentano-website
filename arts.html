        <p>At Brentano, the arts are a core component of the curriculum and our teachers integrate the arts across all disciplines.</p>

        <p>We offer drama for students at all grade levels, as well as weekly arts enrichment for all homerooms. Throughout the year Brentano students publish and share their creative work through musicals and plays, arts festivals, and gallery exhibitions in our school and in our neighborhood.</p>
