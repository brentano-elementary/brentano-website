        <p>
            We know that education is key for student success, therefore
            Brentano aims to give our students the best well rounded education as
            possible. So with that end in mind we want our students to LOVE SCHOOL
            and desire to be part everything we have to offer. Our before and after
            school programs provide enrichment and fun activites that promote a
            well rounded education and love for school. The program is staffed by
            caring teachers that mentor and support our students. Brentano Math and
            Science Academy provides enriched student life and gives every student
            as many opportunities as possible to enhance their learning beyond the
            classroom.

            Our Brentano Family is happy to provide a variety of opportunities for every
            student that attends our school. These opportunities include after school
            programs, sports, clubs and activities, tutoring programs before and after
            school, school wide celebrations, volunteer opportunities, community events,
            and more. The 2013 basketball team was rewarded and recognized this year after
            completing an outstanding season. The team ended up winning first place in the
            end of the year tournament.

            Currently, the sports programs include flag football, basketball, soccer,
            softball, track and field, volleyball, cheerleading, and dance. These athletic
            programs are led by caring mentors who set high expectations for their athletes
            and provide support both on and off the court. We enjoy providing students with
            these opportunities and our students enjoy participating. Come and see a game
            or have your student join in on the fun! Contact Coach Horn for more
            information.
